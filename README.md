# authselect

Manage authselect profile on systems that support it.

This module does not create custom profiles or deploy them.
For consistency, you are advised to package them up and then
deploy that package rather than build them ad-hoc.

## Description

Set your `authselect` profile and any required features.

## Setup

### What authselect affects

This will alter your host's fundemental authentication and lookups via authselect.
Understand what that means before using it.

### Setup Requirements

You will need to start any required services **BEFORE** the authselect class runs.

This class does not track things like `sssd` or `winbind` services.

## Usage

### Basic class usage
Example class invocation:

```puppet
class { 'authselect':
  profile => 'sssd',
  profile_options => [ 'with-mkhomedir', 'with-faillock']
}
```
And the Hiera file would look like:
```yaml
authselect::profile: sssd
authselect::profile_options:
  - with-mkhomedir
  - without-pam-u2f-nouserok
```
### Creating and selecting a custom profile
Example custom profile configuration:

```puppet
class { 'authselect
  profile_manage  => true,
  profile         => 'custom/new_profile',
  custom_profiles => {
    'new_profile' => {
      'base_profile' => 'sssd',
      'contents' => {
        'nsswitch.conf' => {
          'content' => '<your custom nsswitch content here>'
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

And the Hierafile would look like:
```yaml
authselect::profile_manage: true
authselect::profile: 'custom/new_profile'
authselect::custom_profiles:
  new_profile:
    base_profile: 'sssd'
    contents:
      nsswitch.conf:
        content: '<your custom nsswitch content here>'
```

The code above will create a new custom authselect profile called 'new_profile'. The profile will be based off of the sssd profile. The profile will also contain an nsswitch file that will contain the custom content specified in the `content` parameter. To use the new custom profile the `authselect::profile` parameter will need to prefix the name of the custom profile with `custom/` as shown above.

### Facts
This class also provides two facts: `authselect_profile` and `authselect_profile_features`.

## Development

Folks should use the repo listed in `metadata.json`.
